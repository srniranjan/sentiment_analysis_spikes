Try the shut-the-cunt-up; it's breathtaking.
+++++++
Really pretty Starbucks, but also one of the few without any outlets and more tourists than locals.
Not worth it.
+++++++
Leave early or wait in line
+++++++
Avoid the upstairs men's locker room.
It sinks like rotten zombie feet!
+++++++
Pool can get crowded during peak hours.
Either come early or come late
+++++++
This gym is pretty impossible to find, so give yourself an extra ten minutes.
+++++++
Way over priced and probably the worst of the 20 w hotels o have stayed in - something is always wrong with the room and the staff don't care - great bar though - try union squre for a better hotel
+++++++
Burgers are not great (fuck hype)
+++++++
Foods not bad but the music sucks!
+++++++
Don't eat here crappy service
+++++++
Service was sooooo rediculously slow.
Bring your own water.
Good was ok. Would find another Irish pub next time.
+++++++
Bussing staff is rude.
They clear plates before the rest of table finishes eating.
+++++++
Not impressed with this hotel.
Definitely time for a remodel and some of the staff forget it's a service role while still giving you that "NYC Welcome" known around the world...
+++++++
Was not recognized as PC Platinum, received no upgrade, benefits or even a thank you for loyalty.
+++++++
Bring your own pillow and blankie
+++++++
There's no mini bar in the rooms.
At least not in those they put me into.
+++++++
It's no Gino's East
+++++++
Expensive as hell and not great quality go to koront's for a better deal
+++++++
Bad pizza and I'm from NY so it makes it worse.
Lombardis in soho is way better
+++++++
They use MSG in the sauces and some cheeses.
Be carful if your allergic like I am.
Triggered a major migraine and in hospital for 5 hours with IV.
Mtn Dew is good though.
+++++++
Besides the outrageous prices, I saw pizza boxes stacked on top of the trash cans in the back.
Don't order delivery
+++++++
Pizza is ok, but they often 'run out' of cheese pizza, so you have to buy one at twice the price.
Unfriendly service.
+++++++
A very small shop.
M&M's is in front and by far is much better.
+++++++
NOT truly open for all early morning World Cup games.
Don't believe the message on the answering machine!
+++++++
All you can drink is no longer an option unless you have a large crowd.
+++++++
Lombardis....the service is horrendous.
The staff is outrageously unfriendly.
The wait for a table outside is interminable.
The bottom lone is that this place requires new management.
+++++++
be careful....you can make reservations at open table....but they don't honor them if they are full.
+++++++
40 minute wait?!
Don't come here hungry on a Saturday night!
+++++++
40min wait?!
Don't come here hungry on a Saturday night!
+++++++
service sucks!
food sucks!
typical blah times square mediocrity!!!
don't waste your time or money!
+++++++
Service is rude wings aren't that good.
+++++++
Reserve a spot outside on one of the benches.
You will probably not get a place to sit inside.
The seating area also stinks a bit.
+++++++
At least the shape of this place is conducive to lines, because that's all they have here.
+++++++
Never get any sandwiches here.
I tried both veggie options on two different occasions.
Wasn't good at all, I threw it.
+++++++
No decaf iced coffee :(
+++++++
#estebantip: don't order burgers because they won't sell you one.
+++++++
The free offer says 1.50 off any smoothie but they dont have smoothies.
Jamba juice here I come
+++++++
Smoothies (especially gelato) are so over priced.
+++++++
Unfriendly staff and breakfast is awful.
My room was a decent size and clean.
+++++++
Try to avoid
+++++++
They stir your BOILING HOT oatmeal with a PLASTIC SPOON.
So yes, it's slightly less poisonous than nearly everything else on the menu--and it tastes great--but you're gonna get cancer.
+++++++
Don't come here for the restroom.
The line is about 10 men always.
Can't imagine what's happening at lady's rooms
+++++++
Don't use the restroom over here cause the line to it always long
+++++++
Please don't use the beach as your ashtray!!!
Children play here!!
!
+++++++
The beach is not an ashtray.
Although this one sure looks like one.
Really such a shame since the close proximity of the playground to water make it perfect for parents!
:( The water is dirty too.
+++++++
Veg noodles suck big time.
+++++++
Please don't tell anyone about this great noodle place!
+++++++
They now charge for samples :(
+++++++
Was fun, until the bartender cursed us out.. just for being a bit noisy, no manners
+++++++
Full of idiots
+++++++
Been sitting at the bar for ten minutes without being served or acknowledged.
Have come here before but probably never coming back!
!
+++++++
This place used to be good but they can't seem to keep a consistent menu and what they offer now is mediocre at best.
Not to mention the inattentive service on a slow night.
I understand why its empty
+++++++
Great view!
Food taste like shit and the African manager is a dick
+++++++
Nice view - but the service is incredibly slow...
+++++++
On first check-in I never got my appetizer after asking about it multiple times.
Just a heads up.
I did however receive my free drink.
+++++++
The price for breakfast must be a joke
+++++++
Went on fathers day and we were very disappointed... Poor service and food quality ..
Lesson learned !
!
+++++++
The Caesar Salad is good but taste's a little like moth balls
+++++++
if you don't have the lunch/dinner, U won't be allowed to sit on the big table.
It's really bad.
+++++++
Food was good.
Waiter takes forever.
Bad atmosphere.
Maybe I'll come back.
Wasn't thrilled
+++++++
Not impressed, just got baked goods/pastries to go (Canoli, black & white cookie, lintzer cookie...).
The  lintzer cookie was the best of the trio
+++++++
Iced tea lemonade should be called iced tea lemon juice.
When I asked for simple syrup I was pointed toward the powder sugar.
No.
+++++++
Typical Korean business... Take money, don't care about customers, and will be closed within 2 years.
+++++++
Skip the line.
I never say this, but the ridiculous waits make Starbucks a better choice
+++++++
A great place to go if you're having an existential crisis, since the verdict will probably be... No, you don't exist.
+++++++
Absolutely the worst customer service of any coffee shop in America.
Great coffe, but you've never seen so many staff do so little, so slowly.
Manager must be the biggest a hole on the planet.
+++++++
Count your change!!!!
If you buy a drink for $15.25 (for a crappy mojito) they will try to charge you $16 and say that "the manager is not here so we don't have sny silver.
" wtf?
+++++++
If I wanted to drink orange juice all day I'd do it from the comfort of my bed.
And for $25 less.
+++++++
I find the atmosphere noisy.
Went for anniversary dinner.
It was so packed and noisy.
Felt like I was at a bar.
If you plan on a quiet meal, this isn't the place.
+++++++
Don't go here but if you do get an Oreo friend-Z
+++++++
Do not recommend you eat anything here except for ice cream.
Super melt was absolutely disgusting.
Couldn't even eat it.
+++++++

Natasha roll (lobster tempura, mango, salmon) is the f shit bomb here!
+++++++
They don't have happy hour specials but you can split a bottle of wine in a great location with great staff for a good price.
Say hi to the homeless guy, Charlie, for me!
+++++++

+++++++
If you're ready to lose it and start to run people down...step into here.
It's like a time warp!
From all the mayhem to tranquilly just by walking through a door!
Drinks are great too!
+++++++
The caipirinhas taste a bit funky since they are made with cranberry and apple juice.
+++++++
The Tuna TarTar is SERIOUS!

Radicchio salad...grossest thing I've ever eaten.
Nice staff though and cool vibe.

Personally think w in Hoboken is a lot nicer
+++++++
Good size slices.
Not all the way cooked.
Blah
+++++++
Pizza where I am from (San Antonio, Texas) is way better.
+++++++
They APPARENTLY don't have plain pizza X!
+++++++
Food was decent but the service left much to be desired.
+++++++
Had to give the order 3 times and then forgot to make my brother's order.
I understand it gets busy but...really?

Recently out of the starbux brand soymilk constantly.

+++++++
Dont come here.... Trust an Asian.
+++++++
Yes, this is definitely an authentic Japanese restaurant, complete with Mexicans in the kitchen.
+++++++
The mojito is a pina colada on the rocks- bummer.
The whole purpose of a crisp summer drink down the drain :(
+++++++
This place really needs a dedicated lunch menu.
The grilled chicken sandwich is great, but I don't know how many times I can have it... (Also, kind of hard to eat as a sandwich on such crusty bread).
+++++++
The people serving the food are very nice and friendly.
However the 2 cashiers are not only unfriendly they are extremely rude!
+++++++
WARNING: Celebrities, notably Jason Schwartzman, have been known to receive preferential treatment here.
If your barista is dawdling with your latte to favor his, tell her to "rush more.

When you come with 9 people it takes like an hour to get your food.
No joke.

Wanted to dine at this establishment but the marina was too small to be able to dock my yacht.
They need a larger marina.
+++++++
Wow.
Awful wouldn't do this place justice.
Chili's across the street would be considered fine dining in comparison.
Run.
+++++++
Food was only ok.
I was expecting something better.
We were seated in the corner away from everyone else and with no view.
+++++++
Asked to sit inside, hostess said only outside available, asked manager and she sat us inside, hostess told manager we never mentioned the inside.
Food better be good

After read the tips I only had courage to order a panini.
And, it's was ok.
In a place where you can eat anything-anytime, nothing can be so good...
+++++++
Came when it was slow.. Was sat & waited over ten minutes to be greeted by the same server who sat us.
Food- just okay for the price.
Server only checked on us once & employees were sitting & texting.
+++++++
Don't expect any refills on your drink, and if the place isn't busy the staff will hide or watch the TV.
Food is good, over priced though.
Enjoy.
+++++++
The mozzarella could taste more fresh for the price.
+++++++
So Crowded ... Be ready to push some little kids out the way.
People will also try to cut you in line.

Don't have OJ immediately post wheatgrass shot.
The acidity just cancels out it's benefits.
Wait 5 minutes.
+++++++
I live here.
It's chill.
+++++++
Feels like a dinner, not a bar.
Usually has some sort of live music on the weekends.
Not my first choice in Patchogue, but cheap beer specials and lack of a cover charge are always good things.
+++++++
Get the chicken parm sandwich... With marinade instead of marinara.
They did it by mistake to mine and it is AWESOME!
+++++++
The bouncer Adam is hott!
+++++++
The Tuna Tacos are freaking amazing.

Although on the pricey side, sushi and sashimi here is great, and view is nice as well.
+++++++
Get a glass of Torrontes and watch the world walk by.
+++++++
A drink before a show
+++++++
Marble mocha macchiato is my favorite!

When I've finished traveling at the speed of light, I Grab a Iced Americano.
+++++++
Checking place

Very nice rooms,front desk and maid staff very nice.....no free wifi and breakfast prices are a joke

I don't know what I would do without TKTS.If you want to see a TOP Broadway Show,have friends come in town at the last minute, and haven't reserved your tickets,this is THE place to go!Half-Price too!
+++++++
They have TONS of electrical outlets here!!!!!
Almost two for every table!
!
+++++++
Sit in the back.
It's like a library.
+++++++
Service not the best but has free wifi and lots of room to work.
+++++++
Lucky is the backbone of this place - she's absolutely incredible, especially when you're stressed out about a sick pet.
+++++++
This is a sick venue.
They didn't skip a step when creating this masterpiece.
Lot's of details.
Clean, hip, and there's a pizza bar to the left when you walk in.
I could live here!
+++++++
Sick music venue...a must do!!!

If you want to wait in line behind the dumbest people on earth come here.
+++++++
Horrible service!!!
All the orders were messed up and the staff could care less.
+++++++
Worst Starbucks in NYC!
Avoid!!
!
+++++++
The strippers don't Really like you.
+++++++
Go through the garage entrance to the hotel, u will get to experience the most pointlessly difficult to traverse revolving door east of the Mississippi.
Use the normal doors on either side instead.
+++++++
Not the best spin location.
The room has no air flow.
+++++++
Poor AT&T reception.
Dealbreaker for me.
Can't stream music or even check email.
Much better at equinox or golds gym few blocks down
+++++++
Taking a shower is like standing in a rain of needles.
Not enjoyable.
+++++++
Absolutely disgusting.
Cramped locker room, filthy machines, smells like koolaid.
+++++++
Look out for all the bums, they are everywhere.
+++++++
Entrée portion salads are small
+++++++
RIPPED US OFF POST HURRICANE SANDY.
Falsely advertising happy hour.
Stay away.
+++++++
7$ beer during happy hour...no thx!!
!
+++++++
FRAUD.
Doesn't honor their check in special even though it's still active.
LIARS.
Stay away.
+++++++
uh, brooklyn lager doesnt count for the "domestic" beer discount.
shitty.
how much more domestic can you get in NYC?
+++++++
The foursqare special doesnt include all domestic beers.
Don't be fooled.
+++++++
They cheat!!!!
Do Not beliefe them.
Do nor go.
They ripp you off !!
!
+++++++
Bartenders at the hotel bar are bitchy and snobbish.
Don't tip them.. Maybe a dollar.
+++++++
2 Heinekins: $20... Not that I would order that crap, just sayin
+++++++
Not a very comfy bed.
:-(
+++++++
Pizza sucks here.
It's cold & the sauce is flavorless & the service sucks.
+++++++
Just not really worth it.
Find something else.
+++++++
The special slices are good, but it's ridiculous that they'd be out of regular old cheese.
The Sicilian was garbage, all spongey and not crispy at all.
A little overpriced...
+++++++
Not as good as the cranberry deli pizza
+++++++
Ugh.... No crispy crust....NOT real city pizza
+++++++
Too expensive.
Bad service.
5.99 per slice!
+++++++
Sometimes they "run out" of cheese and you have to buy a $6.00 slice... Not cool
+++++++
Portions have gotten a lot smaller, so sad.
+++++++
Good sushi but very limited menu options, which disappointed me.
+++++++
Worst service ever
+++++++
The bartender rocks but the rest of the serving staff sucks.
The waitress just told me she could not get me a beer.
Lame place.
+++++++
No more drink specials!!
Only open Thurs-Sun.
:( boo!
+++++++
I think the bar stools are deliberately uncomfortable ... Bring your own ...
+++++++
The self parking is nonexistent, but don't  worry the valet guys will accost you while you're on the street!
+++++++
You can see time square from here.
Wouldn't recommend it.
Ether.
+++++++
Terrible service.
Go with friends.
+++++++
Horrible service.
The food was not as expected.
+++++++
Service is so bad !
Run away from this restaurant...
+++++++
40 minutes  wait?
It's not worth it, seriously.
+++++++
Few bathrooms.
Potty before you get there, and avoid liquids during the first act if you don't want to miss the show.
+++++++
Slow... Long lines & slow service..
+++++++
Lemon pound cake required a reminder to be given to us.
Caramel frappucino was bitter as tasted different from those at the other outlets.
Service is slow.Be prepared to… (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)
+++++++
Forget about sitting here for 15 minutes while having your coffee.
Internet parasites ocupy all the tables... As usual.
Probably for hours...
+++++++
Once ur decaf has been caffed, u get wary :-/
+++++++
Very hard to find.
Hole in the wall place down in the basement.
Food was cheap and good.
Place smelled like bleach.
Bad customer service.
+++++++
$2 Tuesday gelato is no more :'(
+++++++
Stupid Tea House.
+++++++
This place makes me want to vomit.
Why do I keep coming here?
+++++++
Don't visit here.
It sucks
+++++++
The chili is spicy as hell!
Don't do it!
+++++++
Place is boring beyond words.
Ordinary place with an ordinary atmosphere.
Nothing interesting going on.
+++++++
Found someone else's leftover sandwich in our room.
Don't consider bringing many clothes as there's nowhere to hang them.
It's a rip off.
+++++++
super small rooms and very dark.
probably not good for old people.
+++++++
The lobster roll sucks.
People who enjoy it have obviously never eaten a good  one.
+++++++
Not a very good experience staff is being very nasty
+++++++
Very crowded nasty waitresses and no one wants to go out of there way here to make u feel good
+++++++
I didn't like the fries when I got here, and I've been to a lot of McDonald's.
+++++++
Too many ghetto and crack heads smh
+++++++
Used to love this place but it has gotten very disappointing.
I work around the corner do get takeout and the ingredients in the ramen have changed, decreased or disappeared.
+++++++
4sq recommendation.
went with high hopes.
chicken was extremely dry.
asked to replace dish.
manager had a very awkward argument w/me about my request.
embarrassing.
will not return.
mediocre food.
+++++++
Beware: their Yaki-Soba does not actually contain Soba (Buckwheat noodles).
And their Gyosa have trouble staying closed.
+++++++
They don't take credit cards.
Seriously?
Catch up.
+++++++
Steak and eggs, not the best.
Steak was too dry and eggs were over-cooked.
+++++++
Got bit to hell by Mosquitos at the bar.
I have 14 bites!
+++++++
Worst service I have ever had.
Ever.
+++++++
The manager is super rude.
+++++++
They've changed their coffee cup sizes & the "large" is now actually a medium & they charge the same price.
Total ripoff!
+++++++
Rude bartender is rude.
Don't go here.
+++++++
Beware of the corn bread.
Not too good
+++++++
Uh..
I was drinking a smoothie here and found a plastic piece inside it.
I complained about it but the person told me that it's okay to drink that..... uh... thanks...........
+++++++
$25 minimum for #cc.
And service sucks.
+++++++
Probably worst and most stale Japanese food I've ever eaten.
Their unagi was absolutely rubbery and disgusting.
Sashimi was like eating fish out of the Hudson.
I couldn't down more than two or three b
+++++++
Seriously!?
I'm actually NOT gonna buy any coffee from you just because of that weak-a$$ 10% discount...@ least 20% would be more appropriate...
+++++++
Avoid.
Or make sure your fish is properly deboned!!!
Yuck!
+++++++
Wild mushroom parpadelle, not really 'wild'.I only saw one mushroom.
And the entire dish tasted exactly like the instant Lipton noodles you buy at the store!
And the mushroom burger Equally as awful!
+++++++
They advertised a free drink if you checked in.
they denied me after a few of my friends went.
Said its only for regular business not parties.
False advertising!
If you can't afford it dont advertise!
+++++++
the waiter argued with me that prosciutto and soppressata were both cheeses !
+++++++
Worst Store In Times Sqaure
+++++++
Service was marginal.
Cheesecake to share and die for.
Coffee is horrible.
+++++++
Beyond rude.
Made us wait then wouldn't serve us because we only wanted coffee.
Avoid at all costs.
+++++++
Terrible deli.
There is no heat in the place and the food is overpriced and overcooked.
+++++++
The burger was good, the fries old... All pricey.
the kicker: waiter insisting for 18% tip and told us that's what we should do!
Horribly rude and thought we didn't know better!
Don't go!
!
+++++++
Don't go!
Really expensive, bad service and the waiter insists to have $8 tips for a $50 bill!
+++++++
The food is pretty decent and I suppose you get a lot for your money.
But charging $7 for 2 people to share a dish is robbery.
But it's Times Square so I guess it's expected.
+++++++
Pizza is a bad idea.
+++++++
Corned Beef was dry and turning brown.
Rye bread was also drying out.
While you shouldn't expect much from a Times Square deli, Carnegie is still a better choice.
+++++++
Don't Go!
Dirty Bathroom, serves Wine in liquor glass and everyone is MADD if they serve you!
Stay Away!
+++++++
Don't Go!
Dirty Bathroom, serves Wine in liquor glass and everyone is made if they serve you!
Stay Away!
+++++++
This place blows.
Avoid at all costs.
Overpriced, shitty service, and horrible atmosphere.
Money better spent elsewhere!
+++++++
Bad food and bad service
+++++++
Awful, avoid at all costs.
Anything fried has an awful bitter taste, most likely fr
+++++++
This place was pretty bad, huge portions for huge prices!
Unfortunately you will leave most of it uneaten!
+++++++
Had the nastiest cashier!
He told us there were no waffles!
How could there be no waffles ?
Everyone else was getting waffles!!
Boo.
+++++++
I always used to go for their misugaru shake but I've never experienced such horrible staff service.
Out of the 6 times I went this summer, they screwed up 4x.
Haven't stepped inside since.
+++++++
The espresso here is watery and flavorless.
Prepare for disappointment.
+++++++
Nice looking place.
Horrible service.
Slow.
Overpriced.
+++++++
What a bunch of money monger DBs here... No sense of customer service, no class.
+++++++
Beware of the roaches!
+++++++
Unbelievably ghetto staff.
Awful food.
Unfortunate, Times Sq location that doubles as a rest stop for tourists.
At the very least, the interior isn't too bad.
Free wifi
+++++++
Coffee sucks,  waffles small and over priced.
Staff in la la land...
+++++++
The worst place ever have in NY.
+++++++
Awful food.
Awful bathroom.
AWFUL waitress!
Do NOT eat here!!!!!
!
+++++++
This place is horrible.
Walk AWAY!
!
+++++++
The worst onion soup ever!
( if you could call that a onion soup...)
+++++++
Worst food ever!
Everythng was unorganized.
Soda was flat.& my cobb salad was way over priced.My lettuce wasnt even green.&they gave me mayonnaise for my dressing so my sald was ruined.
Never again...
+++++++
Worst crab cake I have ever had.
All bread.
No flavor.
+++++++
No atmosphere considering it's location.
Not classy enough for the high prices, service was poor.
Food was average at best for the price.
+++++++
The wait staff is highly incompetent...learn your fucking menu && drink specials idiots!
+++++++
the day after Irene...you get the feeling this place cares about money not people...I wouldn't go there for a meal unless for some reason you are a tourist forced to be in Times Square.
+++++++
Horrible desserts.
Tasted like the grease smell throughout the place.
Sent them back.
My date was feeling Daring so he got a replacement that tasted horrible too.
We had to pay for it
+++++++
The WORST pancakes in the world!
Drink here, don't eat!
+++++++
worst friendlys ever.. expect to wait forever for the WRONG THING
+++++++
Don't go to this Friendlys.
They always manage a way to F up the order.

+++++++
Best egg white frittata on the planet!!
!

Great oysters also, very good for restaurant week.

Defiantly ask about drink prices.
A 2 oz pour of Bulliet rye cost me $15 but it's time square so what can you do.
Scrambled eggs and bacon were Awsome.

+++++++
Ask the barista for their specialty!
+++++++
Cold brew coffee is glorious, but easy to mess up.
Roast does it right.
+++++++
If you are a coffee drinker, you owe it to yourself to try Roast's coffee as a french press.
Utterly delicious and addictive.
+++++++
Roast makes really good coffee.
I drink mine black, and they make a well balanced brew.
Not too bitter and not too weak.
If you like full bodied and rich ice coffee, get it done Tiffany's way.
+++++++
Almond mocha is delicious!
Currently one of the barista's choice.
+++++++
Great ambiance, awesome staff.
Support your local businesses!

I had some friends come into town and they had heard the stories about the "mini" hotel rooms that New York City is known for.

I didn't have any.

Red velvet latte is amazing!
+++++++
I love their book store , music and environment - like an Asian hipster place as an alternative to Starbucks in midtown
+++++++
The staff improved from the last time I've been there.
Get anything Misugaru!
Latte and the frappe tastes amazing.
+++++++
Sit in the library in the back and regale other academics with your thoughts on the most recent episode of "Downton Abbey"
+++++++
Try the dark walnut waffle with a Spanish latte.
AMAZING.
+++++++
Seems that they have only one person trained on how to make espresso and they are rarely around.
Love the Misugaru latte and waffle with goat cheese so that's a plus
+++++++
I always love the atmosphere here--though their cranberry almond misutgaru frappe tasted terrible...
I'm assuming the baristas aren't that experienced.
The cafe's fairly new anyway.
+++++++
"The iced americano ($2.25) is incredibly strong without tasting burned.
The maple leaf latte ($4.35) is sweet without being sickeningly so, and if you get the right barista they will even draw..."
+++++++
So many snacks and beverages to choose from!
One of our favorite places to grab coffee in the morning!
+++++++
This place is great.
Wifi is light speed and you can work here - tables and lots of them.
Starbucks beware!

If they're not cooking in house, head to Delfiore's around the corner.
The same pizza, by the slice!
+++++++
An outdoor terrace on the 4th floor offers breathtaking views of Times Square, as does the observatory deck on the roof.
+++++++
I found this place to be good, different than most
+++++++
Nice place
+++++++
The buffalo chicken sandwich and the salumi panini are fantastic.
Great vibe with open walls to the activity of the street.
+++++++
This place just needs help!
Not only is the service slow but the food came out wrong and to the wrong table.
Yes please put the food on my table that someone already touched.
That's just love.
+++++++
Easily the BEST cheesecake in NYC!
+++++++
Happy hour all day!
Aaaaammmmazing!
Tell Lana hello
+++++++
Nice environment, good service, decent enough steak for Times Square, definitely a good, inexpensive alternative to some of the pricier steak houses

What you think is a small bag of M&M's may be bigger than you think and may end up costing $100 or more quite easily!
You get to pick your colors though, and many colors there are.
+++++++
The coconut ones are delicious.
+++++++
This is a surreal place to be at midnight.
+++++++
Do shrooms before coming here to heighten the experience.

Go here after seeing a Broadway show to get away from the crazy Times Square crowds.
+++++++
This place is hot.
Great music and great crowd.
+++++++
Went there once a & it left such a good impression.
It's like going to Aspen, without going all the way to the real thing.
Don't forget on Fridays ladies get free champers till 11pm while stocks last

The new place is awesome.

We stopped in because of restaurant week- super impressed with the food, we'll be back!

In the bar area, if a bell rings and someone yells,"Drinks on the lights!
